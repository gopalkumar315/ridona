# ridona
## Read big files and database tables with millions of rows without memory concern.
Processing big files like CSV,TXT and...always been a problem in php and there are two major problem.
* Memory limitaion.
* Using poor techniques for reading<br>.
**Now with `ridona` you can read files in gigabytes, database tables with millions of rows, yeah baby!** 
## ridona advantages
* Read big text files.
* Read Database tables with millions of records.
* Tuned with php generators and other techniques to use lowest memory as possible.
* Search through all rows of all tables in database.

Install ridona via composer:
```
composer require hosseinmousavi/ridona:dev-master
```
Then include composer autoload file:
```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
Or just include the autoloader
```php
require 'src/autoload.php';
```

### Reading Files
**Only text file like txt,csv... are supported now and other formats like doc,docx,html,pdf will be support in future versions.**


For reading files there are three modes
* by_chunk()
  With this method you can read big files part to part, you can pass `chunk_size` in method, the default value is 10,000 bytes, it means in evey iteration you get 10,000 bytes of the file
```php
$file = new ridona\File('./tests/files/lorem_ipsum_1.txt');
foreach ($file->by_chunk() as $chunk) {
  ....do
}
```
**you should use `by_chunk()` only in `foreach,for or while loops`.<br>**

For example read files of a directory by chunk.
```php
$file = new ridona\File('./tests/files');
foreach ($file->by_chunk() as $chunk) {
  ....do
}
```
take this, you have a directory of files and want to extract emails from those files, for this case we can use `Extract::do` to extract that. the `Extract::do()` method accepts an array for input and an regex pattern
 ```php
$emails = [];
$files   = new ridona\File('./tests/files');
foreach ($file->by_chunk() as $chunk) {
  $matches = ridona\Extract::do($chunk, ridona\RegexPattern::$email);
  $emails  = array_merge($emails, $matches);
}
var_dump($emails);
```
You can use any regex, just pass it as second parameter to `Extract::do()`.
* by_entire()
  If you use this method you load the entire file into memory at once (using `file_get_contents()`) and maybe encounter memory exhaustion problem.
 ```php
$file    = new ridona\File('./tests/files/lorem_ipsum_1.txt');
$content = $file->by_entire();
```
You can pass a directory or a file path to `File()`.
 ```php
$file    = new ridona\File('./tests/files');
$content = $file->by_entire();
```
* by_line()
  In this method we read files line by line using php `file()`, so the file will load into an array at once and maybe encounter memory exhaustion problem.
```php
$file = new ridona\File('./tests/files');
foreach ($file->by_line() as $line) {
  ....do
}
```
**`by_line()` method do not accept any arguments and read each line in evey iteration.**

### Reading database tables
Like files we can read tables in two mode.
* by_chunk()
  We use database limit, offset commands to read table part by part, the default chunk size is 1000 so
  the first executed command is like `select * from table_name limit 10000 offset 0` and second one is
  `select * from table_name limit 10000 offset 10000` and so on.
```php
$database = new ridona\Database('mysql:dbname=nrpmem97_01;host=127.0.0.1', 'root', '', 'nrpmem97_01');
foreach ($database->query('select * from table_name')->by_chunk() as $row) {
  ....do
}
```
You can pass limit value as `chunk_size` to `by_chunk()` and be carefull that you can't use limit or offset commands in chunk mode because we use it already.
```php
$database = new ridona\Database('mysql:dbname=nrpmem97_01;host=127.0.0.1', 'root', '', 'nrpmem97_01');
$emails=[];
foreach ($database->tables()->by_chunk() as $row) {
  ....do
}
```
Or
```php
$database = new ridona\Database('mysql:dbname=nrpmem97_01;host=127.0.0.1', 'root', '', 'nrpmem97_01');
$emails=[];
foreach ($database->tables(['table_name1','table_name2'])->by_chunk() as $row) {
  ....do
}
```
* by_entire()
  In this method we use `select * from table_name` to fetch table then iterate over pdo `fetch(PDO::FETCH_NUM)` method and return one row per iteration also there might be memory exhaustion problem.
```php
$database = new ridona\Database('mysql:dbname=nrpmem97_01;host=127.0.0.1', 'root', '');
foreach ($database->query('select * from table_name')->by_entire() as $row) {
  ....do
}
```

### Read all tables in database
There is a very cool feature here and it is reading all tables with `table()` method, see below.
```php
$database = new ridona\Database('mysql:dbname=nrpmem97_01;host=127.0.0.1', 'root', '', 'nrpmem97_01');
foreach ($database->tables()->by_entire() as $row) {
  ....do
}
```
Also you can specify the tables you want.
```php
$database = new ridona\Database('mysql:dbname=nrpmem97_01;host=127.0.0.1', 'root', '', 'nrpmem97_01');
foreach ($database->tables(['table_name1','table_name2'])->by_entire() as $row) {
  do...
}
```
**We can read all tables in database using `by_entire()` or `by_chunk()`.**<br>

We can extract for example emails from databse.
```php
$database = new ridona\Database('mysql:dbname=nrpmem97_01;host=127.0.0.1', 'root', '', 'nrpmem97_01');
$emails=[];
foreach ($database->tables(['table_name1','table_name2'])->by_entire() as $row) {
  $matches = ridona\Extract::do($row, ridona\RegexPattern::$email);
  $emails  = array_merge($emails, $matches);
}
```
Cool ha!

### Considerations
1. Only MySQL database tested with this library and i need your cooperation to see other databases compatibility.<br>
2. if your file or database is very big in both cases use by_chunk() method and if you encounter memory problem decrease chunk_size.<br>
3. Because this library use php generators in by_chunk(),by_line() methods when parsing files and by_entire(),by_chunk() in tables you only can use returned content in foreach,while and for loops and not in array_walk,array_reduce,array_map and array_filter.<br>
